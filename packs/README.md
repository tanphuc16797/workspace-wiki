# Domain Packs

## Purpose

The wiki-template core engine is **stack-agnostic** — it only keeps workspace isolation, retrieval pipeline, evidence pipeline, and generic rules (no-hardcoded-config, constructor-injection, domain-no-new-states, ...).

Stack-specific knowledge (Kafka/MQTT, REST, frontend, mobile, AI/agentic, ...) lives in **packs** — modular bundles that can be enabled/disabled per workspace.

## Pack structure

```
packs/{pack-name}/
├── pack.yaml                          # manifest
├── README.md                          # docs
├── agents/
│   ├── constraints.md                 # additive constraints
│   ├── coding-rules.md                # additive coding rules
│   └── pipeline/
│       ├── validator-rules.md         # rule table (prefix pack-{name}-)
│       ├── retrieval-map.md           # component → file map
│       └── prompt-overrides.md        # self-check additions
└── scripts/
    └── rules.py                       # Layer-1 rule functions for validate.py
```

## Lifecycle

1. **Workspace opt-in**: add the pack to the `## Packs` section in `workspaces/{ws}/workspace.md`:
   ```md
   ## Packs

   - pack-event-driven
   ```
2. **Pipeline resolution**:
   - Engine constraints/rules are **always** loaded first (immutable).
   - Each pack is loaded sequentially (alphabetical) — additive.
   - Workspace-level overrides (`{ws}/agents/...`) are loaded last — additive.
3. **Validator**: `scripts/validate.py` resolves active packs from the workspace, dynamically imports each pack’s `scripts/rules.py`, and appends them to `ALL_RULES`.

## Naming conventions

| Layer | Rule prefix |
|-------|-------------|
| Engine | (none) — e.g. `no-hardcoded-config` |
| Pack | `pack-{name}-` — e.g. `pack-event-driven-kafka-no-hardcoded-topic` |
| Workspace | `ws-` — e.g. `ws-no-mongodb-direct` |

The loader is fail-fast when duplicate rule names are found across layers.

## Conflict & priority

- **Strict-only direction**: pack/workspace can only ADD or tighten rules. They cannot relax engine rules.
- Pack manifests may declare `conflicts_with: [other-pack]` — the loader fails fast if both are enabled in the same workspace.
- Constraints are expressed additively — all active rules must hold at the same time.

## Create a new pack

**Fast path** — use the scaffold generator:
```bash
python scripts/scaffold-pack.py pack-{your-name}
```
This generates all 8 files (pack.yaml, README, 5 agent docs, scripts/rules.py with built-in `_vio()` helper). Then customize: `pack.yaml` components + keywords, `constraints.md`, and add rule functions to the `RULES` list in `rules.py`.

**Manual path** (when you need fine-grained control):

1. Copy `templates/pack.yaml` → `packs/{your-pack}/pack.yaml`.
2. Create the folder structure above.
3. Write constraints/rules with prefix `pack-{your-pack}-`.
4. Test with `python scripts/validate.py --file <fixture> --workspace <ws-with-pack>`.
